Driving in the car with my wife, she turns to me and asks a very interesting question.

Are the problems in the USA due to our collective lack of pride? Not ego, but pride in who we are, what we have, where we came from.

So much time is spent tearing down our historical past, our government, and each other we lose sight of the blessings and privileges we have.
