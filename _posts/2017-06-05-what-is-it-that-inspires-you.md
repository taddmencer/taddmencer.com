Where do you find things that get your mind moving? What motivates you? Where do you find the inspiration to continue writing words?

  * Creating works of art?
  * Caring for others?
  * Loving on another?

## We need to find the sweet spot. {#we-need-to-find-the-sweet-spot}

We all desire a place where we can feel inspired, excited and motivated. A place where we go to think, pray / medicate, read, zone out, and just be at peace. We all need a place to feel like we can connect with that inner child. The one who whispers those dreams and aspirations that in our adulthood and mature pragmatism we’ve tried to ignore.

## Embrace that inner child {#embrace-that-inner-child}

I try and teach my oldest son how to find joy in little things. Once, as we drove through the city of Grand Rapids, I challenged him to find details and little things. To get excited about them. He did it with gusto and soon was pointing out architectures, trees, squirrels on the street and even how a telephone pole was leaning. We found amazing little things in old buildings, strange old sculptures, interesting flourishes around doorframes. It was magical, inspiring, and exciting.

**Here is a challenge for you:** _Where do you find inspiration?_ Find small details in a day and mentally record them. It doesn’t have to be earth shaking. Something simple like a shadow against an object or a phrase someone said. Something you read. The way the breeze feels on your cheek when someone walks by. Find something that inspired or entranced you, and comment on this post. Tell me what it was and, if you can, why it stood out to you.

_Everyone needs to find something to be inspired by._
