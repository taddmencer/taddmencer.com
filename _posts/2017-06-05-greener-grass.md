_The grass is always greener on the other side._

This popular phrase is applicable to so many things. Life in general always looks better when you’re looking at it from a different angle. What you have never seems good enough. If only you could get across the fence to the fields that seem to flow with milk and honey! Life would be so grand there, wouldn&#8217;t it?

What happens when finally you get to that greener pasture and you find it infested with ticks?

Or you find moles have dug themselves through the entire lawn making it impossible to take a single step without sinking?

Perhaps it’s that grass that you can buy in rolls to make it look like you have healthy grass, but instead it dies within a few months because the soil beneath is bad.

Even worse&#8230; it’s plastic, fake grass. It&#8217;s simply for decoration, not real enjoyment.

Rather than always looking for the greener pastures, maybe it would be better to see how you can tend your own lawn and make it grow.

> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. – Philippians 4:11 (KJV)

_PS: This is not a reflection on how I feel about my current job. I just want to insure that’s know before anyone makes a stink. My job is awesome._
