In a previous job, I was honored and blessed to be the marketing manager and project manager. I was in Lorem ipsum dolor sit ametcharge of making things happen and on time. I was head of a team, and it felt good. We increased productivity, sales, and efficiency.

During a conversation with my direct superior, he told me he wanted to increase sales and launch new products. I asked a simple question, “Do you have a plan to get accomplish these goals?”

He looked annoyed, turned his monitor to show me the custom sales reporting system we had, and said “This is my plan. Sales.”

The ultimate failing of a company is not knowing that you have no plan. Having a goal is not a plan. Sales are your end result of a laid out plan. Not the plan itself.

When you start your business, make sure you have an outline of how to achieve your goals, as well as what those goals are. The outline is a guide and may be adjusted with time. However, having that guide will help you to reach your destination.
