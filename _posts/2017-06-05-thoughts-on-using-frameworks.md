I may not be the best one to talk on this subject, since I’ve only scratched the surface of the most popular names out there. However, this is my general take on what I feel about html/css/js frameworks.

## What is a framework? {#what-is-a-framework}

When I talk about a framework, I talk about a pre-packaged system of classes, javascript and HTML that starts a project for you. It creates a foundation for you to build and design off. In theory, it sounds good.

In theory.

The problem is, they tend to be over-bloated. You end up with a slew of random named classes and functions. Yes, many of the bigger ones have documentation &#8211; but it’s written by someone who already knows the system and therefore doesn’t read easily.

I’m not against reuse. In fact, I’m quite a proponent of using what’s already available. If it’s useful. The sad fact is, there is a huge tendency to use a system that spits out your design without any real work. Of course, there are a slew of great looking sites built on Bootstrap or Foundation or Gumby, but they tend to all look very similar because they all use the exact same layouts as the next. Content and colors change, but the FRAMEWORK is the same.

## Back peddling {#back-peddling}

Ok, I’ve read enough on the internet to know what’s coming next. There are those die-hard fans who are already salivating over their scathing “your mom” jokes. Hey, I get it. You love your tools. Perhaps in the right hands, the framework can sing.

I get too confused and overwhelmed. I’m the type that will glean what I need and go from there. It feels more my own. More built.

When all is said, use what you know. Use a framework if you wish. Use Sketch or Macaw if you like. Code in notepad for all I care. If it looks great, works great, than it is great.
