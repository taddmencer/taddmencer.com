### I&#8217;m a fraud.

I don&#8217;t mean that in an illegal term. I&#8217;ve not been involved in any criminal actions. I&#8217;m not lying to the world. I am Tadd. That&#8217;s no lie.

And it&#8217;s not a &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the real me&rdquo; kind of thing. Anyone who&rsquo;s met me in person can attest to the type of person I am. Quiet, strange, and usually with a wacky sense of humor that hits when you least expect it.

However, with this website, I&rsquo;ve been lying. Mostly to myself.

## Look at how professional I am!

You see, I tried to set this website up as a Look how professional I really am!&nbsp;profile, when in fact, I&rsquo;m far from it. Sure, I have a skillset that would qualify me within many careers. I tried to showcase quotes and a nice image to be a super professional guy. I realized recently, this isn&rsquo;t me.



It&#8217;s not very likely you&#8217;d find me at a fortune 100 sitting behind a desk in a high priced suit making six figures. Looking out a window at the busy traffic and bustling bodies twenty floors down while sipping wine out of a McDonald&#8217;s straw I stole for a child.&nbsp;



I have the need to be more creative. The freedom to sit down and be &#8230; me.&nbsp;

I was made a nerdy, game loving, fantasy novel adoring geek. Hey, I&rsquo;m ok with that. I much rather roll a d20 for initiative than pretend I&rsquo;m going to be the next [Matt Cutts][1] or [Rand Fishkin][2].&nbsp;

### So what&#8217;s next?

I&#8217;m going to stop over-reaching. My career isn&#8217;t going to hurt if my website isn&#8217;t filled with business recommendations, SEO jargon, and resume content. It does nothing for me. That&#8217;s what LinkedIn is for.&nbsp;

This site will be going back to the original intent. A place for me to talk about whatever I want. Games, books, movies, television, technology, and everything that surrounds such things.&nbsp;

The lesson I learned here? It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been preaching to my three boys for years. Yet I failed (as we all do) to listen to my own words.
