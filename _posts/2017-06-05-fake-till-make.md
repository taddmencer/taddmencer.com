  Have you ever heard the phrase, &#8220;Fake it till you make it&#8221;? I&#8217;ve heard this said on several different occasions, but different levels of employment, and different size of businesses.

  What happens when you do make it, yet you&#8217;ve faked your entire career? You pretended to have necessary knowledge when in fact you don’t?

  I know a business owner who seems to thrive under this mantra. He seems to live it. Making decisions seeming based on nothing.

  In the end .. the business is floundering. Any progress is thanks to his team, because they don&#8217;t fake it. They have learned to survive, you need to really KNOW what you&#8217;re doing, not simply pretend.

  Make you wonder: if you&#8217;ve &#8220;faked it&#8221; all this time, did you really make it?
