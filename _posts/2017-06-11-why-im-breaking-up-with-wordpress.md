title: Why I'm Breaking Up With WordPress
---

Like many before me, I have to admit ... I’m leaving WordPress. It’s not because there is anything wrong with the CMS. In fact, I absolutely love it. It has been a great platform to work with, and I’ll use it in my professional world.

It’s not because of anything Elegant Themes, the developers of Divi did. I love that theme, and I feel it’s been a great boost to so many niche sites it would be foolish not to use it. Flexible and useful.

There are, in fact, two main reasons I’m severing my ties with the fantastic CMS.

### The hosting was getting worse

I’ve bounced around to a few different web hosts in the past. I have to say, for what I can afford (which isn’t much) they all pretty much sucked. And the last host I was on for shared servers really didn’t help. And while Dreamhost is probably fine for static sites that really don’t have a lot to work with, they’re not strong enough for my needs. And I’m not paying $100+ a year for a host that doesn’t fit my needs.

### WordPress Outgrew Me

Strange to say, but WordPress got bigger than I would ever really need for my pitiful little blog. I realized that I didn't need all the features that it offered. I didn't need databases and intense SEO and taxonomies. I didn't have a call for it. I'm not big enough, and honestly probably won't be. If I get to a point that I need it again, WordPress will be patiently waiting for me.

### Hello, Jekyll. Hello, GitHub.

So here I am. I’ve moved to a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) system. I’m running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is light and easy to deal with. Nothing fancy. But fast, light, and reasonable.

I may go back to WordPress again. As I said, if I grow to a point that I need it, I know where to go.

Maybe.
