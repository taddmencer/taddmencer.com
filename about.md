At a previous job, I was asked to provide a bio that could be given to clients. It didn’t need to be long, but give a brief description of who you are.

Since my tendency is to be a fun, silly guy I decided to first give a bio that suited my personality before one that suited my actual job description.

>   **Tadd Mencer – Fire Lord**  
>   Born from the molten lava of a live volcano. His heart beats to the drums of
>   a thousand eager warriors. In the thunder is his voice, commanding his
>   legions. Beware the might of his great arms that lash out like lightning.
>   His army will swarm over his enemies like a mighty flood. He also makes
>   websites for a living.

>   Naturally, that wasn’t used. A much more professional and business-like text
>   was sent. However, it was fun to just cut loose.

Naturally, that wasn’t used. A much more professional and a business-like text was sent. However, it was fun to just cut loose.

So what is the real version? Who is Tadd Mencer, really?

I’m a creative developer who has worn many hats in his professional career. If I was to list them out ... well, let’s list some out in no particular order!

|
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Creative Writer | Project Manager | Print Manager       | Designer   |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Game Designer   | Marketing Manager | Front-End Developer | IT Support |

The list could go on to be more nitty-gritty, but you get the point. I wear
hats, many hats. I’m what people call a generalist, or “jack of all trades”. I
can do many things, which has in the past made me valuable to many companies. I
can relate to many departments, which has enabled me to manage large teams from
creative to technical and understand where they all stand.

I’m a father of three *awesome* boys, and married to a *fantastically,
wonderful* woman since April 22, 2000. I am a member of [Rush Creek Bible
Church](http://rushcreekbiblechurch.org/). Some may say that I’m gaming fanatic.
Most would say I’m an all around nerdy guy. I’m an introvert, but you get me
one-on-one … whoa Nelly hold on to your biscuit basket! We got a bona fide
conversation!

I am Tadd.

Hi.
