                <p>I've been around the block a few dozen times, so it's hard to really pinpoints who, or what, I am. Am I web
                    developer? Well, I've been in that role, but doesn't really speak to who or what I do. What about a graphic
                    designer. Also, a hat I've worn, but not exclusively. </p>
                <p>I am a writer. A weaver of fiction and stories. Whether I'm sitting around a table of like-minded nerds rolling
                    dive, or telling my three amazing sons a story about "The Adventures of the Extraordinary Quick Brothers",
                    it's part of who I am. </p>
                <p>Whether in art, written word, or in a video game, I love building a world in a way that I enjoy. It may not
                    be for everyone, but that's ok. Because I enjoy it. - TM</p>
